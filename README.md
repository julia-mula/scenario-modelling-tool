## Project Description

In many European projects there is a need to organize an experiment involving
participants assigned to specific roles (e.g., police officer, doctor, station manager, or end-user of a tested application). Each person must act in line with their responsibilities to achieve a given objective in a simulated situation.  

Such experiments aim to practice procedures or test new solutions under conditions that closely resemble real life. Often, they require the involvement of dozens of people and significant resources. Planning such activities is a major challenge.  

While there are methodologies describing how to prepare for such experiments (e.g., **TGM â€“ Trial Guidance Methodology**, **CWA 18009:2023**), there is still a lack of a flexible tool that supports the **design of situational scenarios**.  


## The Solution

The **Scenario Modelling Tool (SMT)** is designed to support scenario modelling for:
- exercises,  
- experiments,  
- solution trials,  
- simulators.  

The tool makes it possible to:
- model the environment of the situation (objects, action sites, resources, roles, vehicles),  
- represent processes showing how the situation evolves over time,  
- define possible actions available to participants,  
- collaborate across multiple authors during design,  
- view the scenario from different perspectives:
  - organizers and coordinators,  
  - participants playing assigned roles,  
  - observers and experts evaluating the exercise.  


## Core Functionality

- Create and edit situational scenarios  
- Define roles, resources, objects, and processes  
- Visualize scenario progression over time  
- Comply with established methodologies (**TGM**, **CWA 18009:2023**)  
- Enable multi-user collaboration in real time  
- Export scenarios and related documentation

## What Has Been Done

### 1. Business Case
Defined the problem, objectives, stakeholders, and expected benefits of the project. Provides a foundation for requirements and project planning.

### 2. Use Cases
Created structured scenarios showing how users and systems interact. Helps ensure all functional requirements are captured.

### 3. Requirements & Meeting Notes
Collected and documented stakeholder requirements from meetings. Organized key needs, constraints, and priorities.

### 4. Prototype
Developed initial mockups and wireframes to visualize the solution. Supports early stakeholder feedback and validation.

### 5. Project Plan
Created a timeline with milestones, deliverables, and meeting schedules to guide project progress and coordination.

### 6. Communication Setup
Defined communication channels (Slack/Google Meet, email distribution) to ensure efficient information sharing among the team.
